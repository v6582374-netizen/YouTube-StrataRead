# Translation-agent in Edison

Upstream: https://github.com/andrewyng/translation-agent

Pinned commit: `e0fc605acbb5d78cb7a58a98bc8bd8f0056df49c`, MIT, Andrew Ng 2024.

## Native ownership

Edison's preparation service calls `translation_agent.translate()` from `src/translation_agent`. The original functions own initial translation, reflection, revision, token counting, chunk sizing, full-source context and concatenation. Edison supplies its existing model router through a context-local completion binding. The desktop does not start an upstream server or create another provider client.

| Upstream | Integrated location / contract |
| --- | --- |
| `src/translation_agent` | Same package under Edison's `src/`; public function names, signatures, defaults and plain-text return contract retained |
| `app/{app,process,patch}.py` | `src/translation_agent/webui/`; original optional UI and document/diff operations retained, only relative imports changed |
| `examples/` | `examples/translation/`; scripts and sample texts unchanged |
| Complete tracked tree, tests, docs and metadata | `source.tar.gz`, verified against every file hash in `UPSTREAM.json` |
| MIT license | `src/translation_agent/LICENSE`, included in the wheel and desktop bundle |

The archive is a provenance baseline, not runtime code or an independent project. No nested Git repository or root clone is required. The host's wheel, dependency lock and desktop packager own the live implementation.

`EDISON.patch` records the core changes: lazy standalone SDK construction and six completion-boundary hooks. The new `runtime.py` restores context on exit and isolates concurrent jobs. `prompts.json` contains the original three system templates and eight task-template variants; the desktop settings add two composition templates. With defaults, already-rendered upstream prompts pass through unchanged. Overrides use the original variables and plain-text contract.

## Compatibility entry points

- Python: `from translation_agent import translate`; original signature and default OpenAI behavior outside Edison remain available.
- Example: `uv run python examples/translation/example_script.py` (requires a usable standalone OpenAI key).
- Original optional UI: `sh scripts/translation-ui.sh`. This launches the relocated module using an isolated dependency environment: upstream Gradio 4.37.2 requires websockets <12, while Edison requires >=13. It is a developer compatibility entry, not a desktop service or separate checkout. Its provider selector, document import/export, comparison and cancellation behavior remain in the original source. It does not replace Edison's model settings.

## Explicit host additions and limits

The owner authorized Chinese conversion/bypass, editable prompts, shared model configuration, durable checkpoints, resource budgets and separate manuscript composition. These are host policies around the retained library, not upstream algorithm changes. Legacy JSON-protocol templates are archived and legacy checkpoints require explicit regeneration. No silent continuation under a different contract occurs.

Tests compare original function bodies (excluding only completion hooks), request sequences, signatures and results for short/long and regional/nonregional flows. They also verify custom-template dispatch, concurrent context isolation, preservation hashes and optional UI source parity. Deterministic fixtures establish integration behavior, not translation quality.
